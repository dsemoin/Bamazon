# Bamazon
This is an Amazon-like storefront created using MySQL and Node.js.
The app takes in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.
This project is useful for online stores as well as other data tracking systems.
Users can get started with and get help with the project once it's deployed on Heroku
I will maintain and contribute to the project
These are the screenshots for the working app:
